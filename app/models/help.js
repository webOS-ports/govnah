It differs in behaviour in that it gracefully increases and decreases the CPU speed rather than jumping to max speed the moment there is any load on the CPU.</li><li><b>userspace</b> - Sets the CPU speed to a defined rate as chosen by LunaSysMgr.</li><li><b>powersave</b> - Sets the CPU speed to the min frequency value.</li><li><b>performance</b> - Sets the CPU speed to the max frequency value.</li><li><b>screenstate</b> - Runs at a higher speed when the screen is on and a lower speed when the screen is off.</li><li><b>screenstate-v2</b> - Similar to the original screenstate, but includes vdemand, which decreases and increases voltage in response to CPU load. Voltage scaling is done by a factor method; Low - High, in respective to CPU load. </li><li><b>screenstate-v3</b> - Similar to screenstate-v2, but includes ondemand frequency scaling while screen is on. Screenstate-v3 also performs more agressive voltage scaling. The ondemand feature is tuned for interactive response, not ramp-up like original ondemand governor. No voltage scaling is performed when screen is on and ondemand is enabled, it will voltage scale when screen is off only. When ondemand is disabled, full voltage scaling is performed all the time.</li><li><b>vdemand</b> - Sets CPU to max frequency per policy, with added voltage scaling in response to CPU load. No frequency scaling is performed. The minimum frequency parameter is ignored. Voltage scaling parameters are statically set to user preference to suit the characteristics of their phone.</li></ul>Note: Not all governors are available for all kernels.

In layman terms it re-orders the incoming randomly ordered requests into a more efficient order for accessing the flash memory storage. This can have varying effects on performance.

The standard set of schedulers available when the UberKernel is installed are:<ul><li><b>noop</b> - A simple FIFO queue that uses the minimal amount of CPU/instructions per I/O to accomplish basic merging and sorting functionality.</li><li><b>anticipatory</b> - A controlled delay is introduced before dispatching the I/O to attempt to aggregate and/or re-order requests to improve locality. Using this scheduler may cause higher I/O latency.</li><li><b>deadline</b> - Uses a deadline algorithm to minimize I/O latency for each I/O request. The scheduler provides near real-time behavior and uses a round robin policy to attempt to be fair among multiple I/O requests and to avoid process starvation.</li><li><b>cfq</b> - Completely Fair Queuing maintains a scalable per-process I/O queue and attempts to distribute the available I/O bandwidth equally among all I/O requests.</li></ul>')

The throughput increases gradually until it stays stable. It is decreased as soon as the transfer encounters congestion, then the rate rises again slowly. The window is increased by adding fixed values. TCP Reno uses a multiplicative decrease algorithm for the reduction of window size. TCP Reno is the most widely deployed algorithm.</li><li><b>CUBIC</b> - is a less aggressive variant of BIC (meaning, it doesn\'t steal as much throughput from competing TCP flows as does BIC).</li><li><b>Vegas</b> - emphasizes packet delay, rather than packet loss, as a signal to help determine the rate at which to send packets.</li><li><b>TCP Hybla</b> - aims to eliminate penalization of TCP connections that incorporate a high-latency terrestrial or satellite radio link, due to their longer round trip times.</li><li><b>BIC</b> - uses a unique window growth function. In case of packet loss, the window is reduced by a multiplicative factor. The window size just before and after the reduction is then used as parameters for a binary search for the new window size.</li><li><b>Westwood+</b> - addresses both large bandwidth/RTT values and random packet loss together with dynamically changing network loads. It analyses the state of the transfer by looking at the acknowledgement packets. Westwood+ is a modification of the TCP Reno algorithm.</li><li><b>Highspeed TCP</b> - The main use is for connections with large bandwidth and large RTT (such as Gbit/s and 100 ms RTT).</li><li><b>H-TCP</b> - was proposed by the Hamilton Institute for transmissions that recover more quickly after a congestion event. It is also designed for links with high bandwidth and RTT.</li><li><b>TCP Vegas</b> - introduces the measurement of RTT for evaluating the link quality. It uses additive increases and additive decreases for the congestion window.</li><li><b>YeAH-TCP</b> - is a sender-side high-speed enabled TCP congestion control algorithm, which uses a mixed loss/delay approach to compute the congestion window. It\'s design goals target high efficiency, internal, RTT and Reno fairness, resilience to link loss while keeping network elements load as low as possible.</li><li><b>TCP Veno</b> - is optimised for wireless networks, since it was designed to handle random packet loss better. It tries to keep track of the transfer, and guesses if the quality decreases due to congestion or random packet errors.</li><li><b>Scalable TCP</b> - is another algorithm for WAN links with high bandwidth and RTT. One of its design goals is a quick recovery of the window size after a congestion event. It achieves this goal by resetting the window to a higher value than standard TCP.</li><li><b>TCP-Illinois</b> - uses packet loss information to determine whether the window size should be increased or decreased, and uses queueing delay information to determine the amount of increment or decrement. TCP-Illinois achieves high throughput, allocates the network resource fairly, and is incentive compatible with standard TCP.</li><li><b>TCP Low Priority (lp)</b> - is an approach to develop an algorithm that uses excess bandwidth for TCP flows. It can be used for low priority data transfers without "disturbing" other TCP transmissions (which probably don\'t use TCP Low Priority).</li></ul>Note: Not all TCP congestion controls are available for all kernels.')
